## :file_folder: [UNICEF Data](https://data.unicef.org/)
UNICEF stands for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. It was formed around 1946, and since then it has been playing a crucial role in providing good healthcare facilities and working for the overall development of children worldwide. UNICEF works in over 235 countries and has reached millions of children with the help of basic needs, food, healthcare, education, and well-being. UNICEF works in different regions and with many areas with respect to children. They have been working for more than 50 years, so the data we gather from their website can be used to understand their offerings, current status, and contributions to children’s well-being. We can find educational datasets, immunization data, disease and outbreak details, malnutrition details, and survey data across different time frames, regions, and communities. Today's children are the building blocks of our future, so this subject area is quite important for everyone.

**Educational Aid Dataset Applications:** 
1. To understand literacy snapshots among children from different regions. This will help identify and allocate resources.
2. To provide primary/secondary education facilities, we can analyze the data to find the exact demand and route appropriate resources.
3. With available data on literacy rates, small firms can help UNICEF on skill development programs and on implementing digital platforms for better educational practices.

**Children's Health, Immunization, Nutrition Dataset Applications:**
1. To analyze premature childbirth, disabilities in children, and to create awareness about proper medical and health practices.
2. During a disease outbreak, special treatments can be facilitated for children. This data also helps identify requirements for mandatory vaccination drives.
3. An overall environmental review can be done using this data, and factors causing a negative impact on children's growth and behavior can be identified.
Apart from physical health, it is important to understand the mental health of children. Using survey data and medical records, we can identify the need in this area.
If certain natural or man-made disasters occur, this dataset can be used to provide additional help for children’s survival and ensure they receive basic food, healthcare, and accommodation facilities.
4. To understand the demand for volunteers, regional teams, and inventory demands for food and medical kits. Accordingly, teams can plan and strategize the supply chain.
  


## :book: [**Natural Language Processing**](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_aug25.pdf)
**Author:** ***Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning***

Natural Language processing(NLP) is the process where you can directly ask a question to database using normal language(engish) and it will show the answers. NLP is combination of natural query understanding and generation. Nowadays everyone is using AI bot as search engine or understand solutions to problem and get knowledge. It is related to to prompt enginnering. 
       This book has touched all blocks on understanding problem sentence, break it and analyzing sets, lookback into inbuilt data and try to generate most relatable, right and ethical response. This will definatly help everyone to understand how generative AI chatbots work. This will help how can we implement some block in our work to make it flow smooth and more interactive
