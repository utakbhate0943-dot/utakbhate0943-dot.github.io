### üìÅ[UNICEF Data](https://data.unicef.org/)
UNICEF stands for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. It was formed around 1946, and since then, it has been playing a crucial role in providing healthcare facilities and working for the overall development of children worldwide. The agency works in many countries and has reached millions of children with the help of basic needs, food, healthcare, education, and well-being. We can find educational datasets, immunization records, disease and outbreak details, malnutrition details, and survey data across different time frames, regions, and communities. Today's children are the building blocks of our future, so this subject area is quite important for everyone to explore and analyse.

**Educational Aid Dataset Applications:**
1. To **understand literacy snapshots** among children from different regions. Using ML techniques and visualisations, we can prioritise fund distributions. This will help identify and allocate resources.
2. To **provide primary/secondary education facilities and understand the scope**, we can analyze the data to find the exact demand and route appropriate resources.
3. With available data on literacy rates and using clustering methods to group children sets, small firms can help UNICEF with skill development programs and **implement digital platforms for better educational practices.**

**Children's Health, Immunization, Nutrition Dataset Applications:**
1. To analyze premature childbirth, disabilities in children, and **to create awareness about proper medical and health practices.**
2. During a disease outbreak, special treatments can be facilitated for children. This data also helps **to identify requirements for mandatory vaccination drives**. This data will help to understand patterns and behaviour to monitor action items.
3. An overall environmental review can be done using this data, and factors causing a negative impact on children's growth and behavior can be identified. Apart from physical health, it is important to understand the mental health of children. Using survey data and medical records, we can identify the need in this area. If certain natural or man-made disasters occur, this **dataset can be used to provide additional help for children‚Äôs survival and ensure they receive basic food, healthcare, and accommodation facilities.**
4. To **understand the demand for volunteers, regional teams, and inventory demands for food and medical kits,** these datasets can be analyzed. Accordingly,  one can plan and strategize the supply chain.

### üìñ[**Natural Language Processing**](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_aug25.pdf)

Natural Language processing(NLP) is a combination of understanding queries and generating output. All generative AI bots use this process, where you can directly ask a question to the database using normal language(English) and it will show the answers or related datapoints, or remarks. Nowadays, everyone is using an AI bot as a search engine or to understand solutions to problems and get knowledge. This book has touched all blocks of NLP. It has shown different techniques for understanding problem sentences, breaking queries and analyzing sets, looking back into inbuilt data, and trying to generate the most relatable, right, and ethical response. The book **covers all the basics related to Word and Token analysis, Language models, Regression techniques, and Linguistic structures.**

This will definitely **help everyone to understand how generative AI chatbots work**. This will **help one become a prompt engineer/ an AI engineer or to work on chatbot development from scratch**.
